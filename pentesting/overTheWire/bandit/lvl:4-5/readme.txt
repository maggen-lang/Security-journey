INTRODUCTION:
Password is in the only human readable file in the inhere dir

STEPS:
ls -> se inhere, cd the sucker!
10 files appear. 
Reading file manual -> boring stuff!
Try file * but get weird error saying filename 'ile00' does not exist.
Consult internet -> finds that -file00 is treated as a parameter in file. 
Trying file -- * instead since this should now be the same a saying "no parameters here please" 
badabing -> file07 is the only ASCII containing file
cat that sucker

COMMAND:
file -- * 
cat -- -file07
