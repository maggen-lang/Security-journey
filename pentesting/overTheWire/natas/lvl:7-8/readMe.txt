notes to self:
The page parameter is used by the web application to build a file path on the server, and the server then reads that file and returns its contents in the HTTP response.
When you change it to something like /etc/passwd, you are exploiting a file inclusion / path traversal bug that lets you read unintended local files.
You are not accessing a terminal — you are only making the application open and display files for you.
