For security reasons they now filter on certain characters

still a f***ing view source-code challenge

upon inspection:
same as last but now there is no / ; or other symbols

Bypass ideas -> none.

Research time...
when searching the query parameters are still present in URL -> let GO!

still not working. Further research.

finally some (perhaps) useful information. Grep -i is case insensitive and searches the dictionary. I can add a '.' to search for any letter in the current grep. thus if I add ". /etc/natas_webpass/natas11" I will search for any character in /etc/nasts_webpass/natas11 folder.
If there is no hit then I will try ../natas10. And if still nothing, then I will search for the answer.

but bingo:
