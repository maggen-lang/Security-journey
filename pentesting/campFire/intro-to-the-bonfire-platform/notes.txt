INTRO TO THE BONFIRE PLATFORM:
-----------------------------------------
Learning by doing 
Retrieve a flag (CTF style)
	-> FIRE{a_random_string} 
Stuck?
  -> use hint or FAQ
	-> hints = quick pointers
	-> FAQ well.. is a FAQ, guide I guess

Toolbox 
  -> holds all tools needed 
  -> icon under FAQ, loos like a toolbox
  -> DO SPEND SOME TIME ON READING DOCUMENTATION WHEN DECIDING ON WHICH TOOLS TO USE!

Virtual Laboratory
  -> choose lab or go VPN
  -> browser based lab
	- create lab
	- choose browser
	- wait,
	- open lab
  -> VPN, to be continued 

Practice Makes perfect
  -> a repetition of last section
	- same challenge

We Love Feedback
  -> submit feedback and get flag
  -> but do remember to give feedback now and then, otherwise nothing changes!
  -> if in doubt, use the burger method; good, constructive critique, good again (like jazz, everything ends best, on a good note)
